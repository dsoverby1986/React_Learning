# React_Learning

React_Learning is a repo I'm using to track my progress through Andrew Mead's React/Redux course from Udemy.

[The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)

## Development
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Run `yarn run dev-serve` to build using webpack-dev-server.

Run `yarn run serve` to serve to browser using live-server.
